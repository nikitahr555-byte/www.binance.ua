# Overview

This project is a static web replica of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange website, implemented as a frontend-only demonstration. It contains saved HTML pages that mimic the Binance user interface, including the main homepage, login page, password entry page, and verification pages with working navigation. The project uses a simple Python HTTP server to serve the static files locally, making it suitable for educational purposes, UI testing, or as a reference implementation of cryptocurrency exchange interfaces.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The project follows a static file structure with HTML pages that replicate the Binance interface:
- **Main Pages**: `index.html` (homepage), `login.html` (login page), `password.html` (password entry)
- **Asset Organization**: Static assets are organized in separate directories (`index_files/`, `login_files/`) containing CSS, JavaScript, and supporting files
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS media queries and viewport meta tags for mobile-responsive layouts
- **Component-Based Styling**: CSS follows a component-based approach with prefixed classes (e.g., `_CWC`) for style isolation

## Server Infrastructure
- **Development Server**: Simple Python HTTP server (`server.py`) that serves static files
- **Port Configuration**: Runs on port 5000 with configurable host binding
- **Cache Control**: Implements no-cache headers to ensure fresh content delivery during development
- **Auto-routing**: Automatically serves `index.html` for root path requests

## Authentication Flow Simulation
The project simulates Binance's authentication user experience:
- **Multi-step Login**: Separate pages for email/username entry and password confirmation
- **Third-party Integration Placeholders**: Includes Google and Apple login button references
- **2FA Interface Elements**: Contains styling and structure for two-factor authentication components

## UI Framework Integration
- **External Dependencies**: References to Binance's actual CDN resources and third-party services
- **Icon System**: Uses custom SVG icon system with scalable vector graphics
- **Theme Support**: Implements CSS custom properties for theming and dark/light mode support
- **Internationalization**: Includes Ukrainian language support with proper meta tags and content

# External Dependencies

## Third-party Services
- **Google Services**: Google Sign-In API, Google Analytics, and reCAPTCHA integration
- **Apple Services**: Apple ID authentication service
- **Telegram Integration**: Telegram login widget for social authentication
- **ThreatMetrix**: Fraud detection and device fingerprinting service

## CDN Resources
- **Binance CDN**: Static assets served from `bin.bnbstatic.com` and `public.bnbstatic.com`
- **External Scripts**: Various JavaScript libraries and frameworks loaded from external sources

## Analytics and Tracking
- **Web Analytics**: Google Analytics implementation for user behavior tracking
- **Cookie Management**: OneTrust cookie consent management platform
- **Device Fingerprinting**: ThreatMetrix fraud detection system for security monitoring

## Browser Extension Compatibility
- **Extension Support**: Includes compatibility scripts for various browser extensions
- **Chrome Extension Integration**: Specific support for location and request handling extensions

Note: This is a static demonstration project and does not implement actual authentication, database connectivity, or real cryptocurrency trading functionality.
